Fingerprinting instruments in an NSPC PSRAM image

Another POC
-----------

Just messing around, trying to understand how the Super Metroid sound engine
works by observing various SPC dumps.

Question du jour: do the different areas have different instruments?  If so,
are there any globally shared/fixed instruments (like songs 0-4 are apparently
constant)?
